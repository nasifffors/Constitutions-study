Hello,
I took the letter of the Constitutions of all countries in the world and made the following analysis using "R":
1.- Sentiments as per the lexicon "nrc" in tidytext package.
2.- The differences in lexicon between socialists and capitalists countries.
3.- Count the occurrences of the words containing "soci" and "capit".
